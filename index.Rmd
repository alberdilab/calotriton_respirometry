# Introduction

This webbook contains all the code used for data analysis in study of the individual-level metagenomic data of Podarcis muralis and Podarcis liolepis lizards from different environments during an experimental setup.

## Prepare the R environment

### Environment

To reproduce all the analyses locally, clone this repository in your computer using:

```
RStudio > New Project > Version Control > Git
```

And indicating the following git repository:

> https://github.com/alberdilab/calotriton_respirometry.git

Once the R project has been created, follow the instructions and code chunks shown in this webbook.

### Libraries

The following R packages are required for the data analysis.

```{r load_libraries, warning=FALSE, comments="", message=FALSE}
# Base
library(R.utils)
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(devtools)
library(tinytable)
